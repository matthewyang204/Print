# Printer
This is a completely free Mac app that allows you to print one or multiple files without opening them. It is made with Automator, although it says it was made by Shortcuts due to Automator being based on Shortcuts since macOS 14 (Sonoma).

Requirements: macOS 12 (Monterey) or later

Latest Version: 1.1

To install:
1. Download the disk image.
2. Mount the image and drag the app to the folder that the arrow points to (an alias of your on-disk Applications folder). It might prompt you to enter your admin password, enter it if your Mac asks. The app will now be in your Applications folder.
3. Enable Full Disk access in System Settings by adding it to the list and then making sure that the toggle is on (this is important so that it can access files to print).

To use:
1. Select the folders you want to erase (you can only erase subfolders in the same folder at once) in the pop-up dialog.
2. Click the "Open" button.
3. It will start printing.

To update:
1. Go through install steps 1-2.
2. Delete Printer from your Full Disk Access preferences list.
3. Re-enable full disk access for Printer
