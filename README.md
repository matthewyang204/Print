# Printer
This is a Mac app that allows you to print one or multiple files without opening them.

Requirements: macOS 10.4 or later

To install:
1. Download the .zip file.
2. Extract the file with whatever decompressing software you have (i,e Archive Utility, iZip).
3. Move the app to the Applications folder (if you are using iZip, just extract to the Applications folder directly).
4. Enable Full Disk access in System Settings by adding it to the list and then making sure that the toggle is on (this is important so that it can access files to print).

To use:
1. Make sure that the printer is connected first (WiFi, USB, etc)
3. Select the Finder items you want to print (you can only print files in the same folder at one time).
4. Making sure not to deselect the files, press Command + Space to bring up Spotlight Search.
5. Type "Printer" and hit Enter.
6. It will start printing.
